    The "img" tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both 
    opening and closing tags, but the "img" tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the 
    end of the "img" tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit 
    the final slash — both will render properly.<br><br><br><br>
    The "img" tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set 
    to the image's source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of 
    src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web 
    address or local address where a file is stored.<br><br><br><br>
