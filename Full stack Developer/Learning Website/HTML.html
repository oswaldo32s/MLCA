    <h3 class="header">Headers</h3>
    <p>Headers are useful to make a difference on your website, like a newspaper.</p>
    <h3 class="header">Styling Text</h3>
    <p>
        There are some tags that you can use to <strong>style your website</strong> and make modifications
        to your text for example "strong" that renders the text as bold and "em" that
        renders the text as italic.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Dividers</h3>
    <p>
        The Dividers are markups that helps us separate ideas on our website, these
        Dividers helps us to make sure we apply the correct formatting and structure
        and they help us to organize in a better way our website.
    </p>
    <h4 class="header">Attributes</h4>
    <p>
        If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute.
        Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be
        used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling.
        Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
        The name of the attribute
        The value of the attribute
    </p>
    <h4 class="header">Div</h4>
    <p>
        Div is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections.
        Divs don't inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful
        when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML.
    </p>
    <h4 class="header">Span</h4>
    <p>
        contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small
        pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Lists</h3>
    <h4 class="header">Unordered List</h4>
    <p>
        In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (ul) to create a list of items in no
        particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet
        point.<br><br>
        The "ul" element should not hold raw text and won't automatically format raw text
        into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the "li" tag.
        The "li"or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.
    </p>
    <h4 class="header">Ordered List</h4>
    <p>
        Ordered lists (ol) are like unordered lists, except that each list item
        is numbered. You can create the ordered list with the "ol" tag and then
        add individual list items to the list using "li" tags.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Images</h3>
    <p>
        The "img" tag allows you to add an image to a web page. Most elements require both 
        opening and closing tags, but the "img" tag is a self-closing tag. Note that the 
        end of the "img" tag has a forward slash /. Self-closing tags may include or omit 
        the final slash â€” both will render properly.<br><br>
        The "img" tag has a required attribute called src. The src attribute must be set 
        to the image's source, or the location of the image. In this case, the value of 
        src must be the uniform resource locator (URL) of the image. A URL is the web 
        address or local address where a file is stored.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Videos</h3>
    <p>
        the video element requires a src attribute with a link to the video source. 
        Unlike the "img" element however, the "video" element requires an opening and 
        a closing tag.<br><br>
        Between the opening tag and the closing tag you can write whatever message you 
        want to display when the browser is not able to show the video.<br><br>
        After the src attribute, the width and height attributes are used to set the 
        size of the video displayed in the browser. The controls attribute instructs 
        the browser to include basic video controls such as pausing and playing.
    </p>
    <h3 class="header">Links</h3>
    <p>You can add links to a web page by adding an <em>anchor</em> element (a) and include 
    the text of the link in between the opening and closing tags. The anchor element 
    needs to have an href attribute to work, this is where you add the link or URL. You can 
    add an additional attribute (target="_blank") to make sure the hyperlink opens in a 
    different tab.</p>
    <h3 class="header">Tables</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Tag</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
