    <h3>Headers</h3>
    <p>Headers are useful to make a difference on your website, like a newspaper.</p>
    <h3>Styling Text</h3>
    <p>
        There are some tags that you can use to <strong>style your website</strong> and make modifications
        to your text for example "strong" that renders the text as bold and "em" that
        renders the text as italic.
    </p>
    <h3>Dividers</h3>
    <p>
        The Dividers are markups that helps us separate ideas on our website, these
        Dividers helps us to make sure we apply the correct formatting and structure
        and they help us to organize in a better way our website.
    </p>
    <h4>Attributes</h4>
    <p>
        If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute.
        Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be
        used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling.
        Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
        The name of the attribute
        The value of the attribute
    </p>
    <h4>Div</h4>
    <p>
        Div is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections.
        Divs don't inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful
        when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML.
    </p>
    <h4>Span</h4>
    <p>
        contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small
        pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.
    </p>
    <h3>Lists</h3>
    <h4>Unordered List</h4>
    <p>
        In HTML, you can use an unordered list tag (ul) to create a list of items in no
        particular order. An unordered list outlines individual list items with a bullet
        point.<br><br>
        The "ul" element should not hold raw text and won't automatically format raw text
        into an unordered list of items. Individual list items must be added to the unordered list using the "li" tag.
        The "li"or list item tag is used to describe an item in a list.
    </p>
    <h4>Ordered List</h4>
    <p>
        Ordered lists (ol) are like unordered lists, except that each list item
        is numbered. You can create the ordered list with the "ol" tag and then
        add individual list items to the list using "li" tags.
