        <h3>Headers</h3>
        <p>Headers are useful to make a difference on your website, like a newspaper.</p>
        <h3>Dividers</h3>
        <p>The Dividers are markups that helps us separate ideas on our website, these

        <h4>Attributes</h4>
        <p>If we want to expand an element's tag, we can do so using an attribute. 
            Attributes are content added to the opening tag of an element and can be
             used in several different ways, from providing information to changing styling. 
             Attributes are made up of the following two parts:
            The name of the attribute
            The value of the attribute</p>
        <h4>Div</h4>
        <p>Div is short for "division" or a container that divides the page into sections. 
            Divs don't inherently have a visual representation, but they are very useful
             when we want to apply custom styles to our HTML.</p>
        <h4>Span</h4>
        <p>contains short pieces of text or other HTML. They are used to separate small 
            pieces of content that are on the same line as other content.</p>
